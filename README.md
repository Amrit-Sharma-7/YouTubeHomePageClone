# YouTubeHomePageClone
 This project is a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a YouTube homepage clone. It replicates the basic layout and styling of the YouTube homepage, providing a static representation using only front-end technologies. The goal is to showcase foundational web development skills and create a visually similar user interface to the popular video-sharing platform.
